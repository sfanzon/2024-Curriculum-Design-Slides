|**Type**                | **Percentage of final grade** |
|:-----                  |:-----                         |
|  Coursework Portfolio  | 70%                           |
|  Homework              | 30%                           |



Analysis backed by the following resources:

- **Inclusive Education Framework** (IEF) of Hull University ([Link](https://www.hull.ac.uk/special/inclusive-education)) 


- **Inclusive Assessment, Marking & Feedback Policy** of Hull University ([Link](https://www.hull.ac.uk/choose-hull/university-and-region/key-documents/docs/inclusive-assessment-marking-and-feedback-policy.pdf))


**Evaluation Framework:**

- Inclusive Education Framework Checklist ([Link](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/ld.php?content_id=33865361))




## Inclusive Education Framework Checklist {.smaller}

![](images/IEF_Checklist.png){.r-stretch}




## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #1

`Students are given choices within their assessments to allow for personalisation`

- 10 Worksheets: marked and returned to students with feedback
- Maths Department Policy: Students allowed to miss small # of Worksheets  
*(avoiding the University’s mitigating circumstances process)*
- Allows students freedom to prioritise their preferred topics  
*(all topics are eventually assessed via Coursework at the end of the module)*

In line with [Hull IEF Assessment & Feedback](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback)

- **Be mindful of student workload and anxieties around assessment**
 


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #2

`Module uses a range of assessment formats`


1. 10 weekly Worksheets:
    * Purpose: To provide continuous summative and formative feedback
    * Each Worksheet accounts for a low percentage of final grade 
    * Including low-stakes regular assessments is an inclusive assessment for learning practice


    


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #2

`Module uses a range of assessment formats`


2. Coursework Portfolio:
    * Perform statistical analyses of real-world datasets
    * Report + Discuss statistical analyses 
    * Exactly the same as statisticians working in industry would have to do
    * Opportunity to demonstrate depth of understanding

In line with [Hull IEF Assessment & Feedback](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback)

- **Give students authentic opportunities to demonstrate their skills, knowledge and self-awareness**




## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`Mathematics assessment is designed at the programme level,   giving students a manageable assessment load`


**Assessments sometime clash:**

- Mathematics assessment is **indeed** designed at the programme level

- Managing assessment load is **tricky** 
    * Due to inherently high amount of content for Maths disciplines

- **Example:** Statistical Models students in T2 had
    * At least 1 more module with 10 Weekly Assignments
    * At least 1 more module with Coursework due in last week of T2



## Recommended Enhancement {.smaller}

**Overassessment issue is structural and hard to solve**

**Partial solutions to mitigate issues:**

- Best 7 Weekly Assignments count
    * *([Hull IEF Assessment & Feedback](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback) + Maths Department Policy)*
- I made Coursework available at beginning of T2 + discussed in class    
    *(Point 5 of [Inclusive Assessment, Marking & Feedback Policy](https://www.hull.ac.uk/choose-hull/university-and-region/key-documents/docs/inclusive-assessment-marking-and-feedback-policy.pdf))*

##  {.smaller}

![](images/IC_Checklist_3.png){.r-stretch}





## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example

`My teaching resources are made available in appropriate accessible formats in advance of scheduled teaching sessions wherever possible`

**Digital Slides:**

- Statistical Models: I inherited teaching material in the form of PDF format slides 

- I wanted to use something more accessible than PDFs for my slides 

- Employed digital publication framework [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to write slides  
*(The present set of slides is made with Quarto)*



## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example

`My teaching resources are made available in appropriate accessible formats in advance of scheduled teaching sessions wherever possible`

- Statistical Models digital HTML slides are available at
    * [silviofanzon.com/2024-Statistical-Models-Slides](https://www.silviofanzon.com/2024-Statistical-Models-Slides/)

- Digital slides can be viewed in browsers
    * Allows for easy viewing on various devices, including smartphones
    * Facilitates the use of accessibility features on smart devices  
    *(e.g. text magnification, contrast enhancement)*




## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example

`My teaching resources are made available in appropriate accessible formats in advance of scheduled teaching sessions wherever possible`


- Digital format allows for compatibility with text-to-speech software  
*(overcoming the limitations often encountered with PDFs)* 
    * Beneficial to auditory learners
    * Beneficial to students with visual impairments
    
- My slides are also available in PDF version on Canvas
    * Easy to print


In line with [Hull IEF Curriculum](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Curriculum): **Demonstrate inclusion where possible**
 



## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`I work with students as active partners in curriculum design and delivery`

**(Sometimes) Low engagement in Tutorials:**

- Statistical Models comprises weekly 1-hour Tutorials
- Lecturer reviews solutions to the previous week’s worksheet
- Traditional format which often leads to passive learning
    * students receive explanations for exercises they may have already completed
    * low attendance and engagement



## Possible solution {.smaller}


**Involve students by having them present their solutions**

- I successfully implemented this approach in past modules

- Led to more popular and well-attended tutorials 

- Students engaged in friendly competition, debating their solutions

- Fostered a sense of active participation in curriculum delivery
    

**Goal:** Apply the same approach to the Statistical Models tutorials



## Possible solution {.smaller}


**Major impediments:**

- Many exercises in Statistical Models require coding in R
- **Most students lack access to laptops**    
*(raising concerns about digital exclusion)*
- Holding all classes in computer labs is not feasible

**Positive observation:**

- Every student has access to a smartphone or tablet



## Exploring the literature {.smaller}

**Addressing Digital Exclusion:** Reference [@betts]^[My notes on [@betts] are found in **Reference 1** in the [Annotated Bibliography](/files/annotated_bibliography.pdf)]

- Explores challenge of integrating technology into teaching

- Offers practical guidance through 5 real-world examples

- Real-world example #2
    * Promoting self-directed learning through interactive presentations with **hyperlinks**



## Recommended Enhancement {.smaller}

**Practical solution:** How to involve students in Tutorials

- Include links to online R compilers in my tutorial solutions *(e.g. [mycompiler.io](https://www.mycompiler.io/online-r-compiler))*

- Provide R code with missing sections

- Students can complete and run code in a browser
    * can be done on **tablets** or **smartphones** $\implies$ *no computers needed*


- Students can share the online link to their code with me
    * I can display their work on the projector
    * facilitate group discussion around their solution


**Outcome:** Students can present solutions $\implies$ *involved in curriculum delivery*

:::




## Good examples {.smaller}
### SDG 4: Quality Education

**Perform statistical analyses of real-world datasets:** 

- Task aligns with SDG 4 by fostering high-quality education
- Equips students with competencies in data interpretation + critical thinking
- Prepares students for real-world challenges


**Report + Discuss statistical analyses:** 

- Students develop communication skills and ability to convey findings

- Students become better prepared for future professional roles

- Supports SDG 4 by ensuring that students are not just consumers of knowledge but active contributors



## Good examples {.smaller}
### SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

**Analysis of the ENRON scandal by looking at dataset of stock prices:** 

- Task directly addresses SDG 8 by focusing on an instance of corporate governance failure
    * ENRON scandal had significant implications for economic stability and ethical business practices

- Students understand the impact of statistical analyses on business ethics and policy-making 

- Equips students with knowledge to contribute positively to economic growth and decent work environments in their future careers




## Framework 2 - ESD Competencies Checklist {.smaller}

![](images/ESD_Checklist.png){.r-stretch}



## ESD Competencies {.smaller}
### Good examples

``Systems thinking``

- Statistical regressive models are designed to understand relationships between variables

- Nested models are used to compare relationships on different scales

- All Statistical Models can handle uncertainty


``Anticipatory or Future thinking``

- Module includes statistical analyses of real-world examples in Economics and Finance

- Outcome of statistical analyses is used to inform policy decisions




## ESD Competencies {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

``Collaborative working``

**Little room for collaboration in Lectures:**

- Statistical Models comprises 2 weekly 2-hour Lectures

- Current lectures design:
    * Lecturer delivers content with slides and whiteboard
    * Lecturer fosters engagement with direct questions

- This traditional format tends to 
    * foster passive learning 
    * lacks opportunities for student **collaboration**



## Exploring the literature {.smaller}

**Strategies to foster collaboration:** Reference [@pokorny_assess]^[My notes on [@pokorny_assess] are found in **Reference 2** in the [Annotated Bibliography](/files/annotated_bibliography.pdf)]

- Discusses the role of assessment in education

- Explores collaborative learning in formative assessment

- *Team tasks*
    * Students work collaboratively towards solvinga a problem task

- *Students as Teachers*
    * At the end of the problem task students explain solution to each other




## Recommended Enhancement {.smaller}

**Practical solution:** Foster collaboration during Lectures

- Already included numerous worked examples in the Statistical Models Slides
- Easily transform these examples into short tasks for students to solve in pairs
- To promote interest I can include tasks grounded in real-world applications


**Possible impediments:**

- I have already attempted this approach with a couple of tasks this year
- Students really appreciated
- Next year I plan to have 1 interactive task per Lecture
- Low effort high gain strategy -- I see no impediments in implementing it

## Global Competencies {.smaller}
### Good example

``Critical Awareness``

**Assignment: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Education Interventions**

- Students are given
    * dataset containing student performance metrics (i.e. test scores) 
    * details about different educational interventions (i.e. tutoring programs)

- Task: 
    * use regression analysis to evaluate data
    * determine which interventions have the most significant impact on student outcomes



## How is the Competency met {.smaller}

- **Critical Reflection:** Students must critically assess the effectiveness of various educational interventions

- **Evaluating Accuracy** of their regression models
    * checking for potential biases
    * checking that model assumptions are met

- **Continuous Improvement:** 
    * Assignment encourages students to seek out additional methodologies to refine their analysis
    * E.g. they may need to explore advanced regression techniques to improve their evaluation




## Global Competencies {.smaller}
### Areas of Enhancement

- ``Global Challenges`` 
- ``Historical / Cultural Awareness``
- ``Respect & Understanding Perspectives``

**Exceptional Example: Undergraduate supervision**

- I supervised an undergraduate dissertation
    * used methods taght in Statistical Models
    * statistical analysis of Formula 1 races
    * advanced the econometric understanding of Formula 1 modelling

- Dissertation resulted in a publication in a prestigious economics journal [@2024-Fry-Bri-Fan] 


## How are Global Competencies met {.smaller}

``Global Challenges``

- Relevance: 
    * Paper addresses a problem with broader societal or global implications (e.g. sports modelling, economic forecasting, climate modelling)

- Impact: 
    * Paper contributes to the broader application of statistical and econometric methods in real-world scenarios (e.g. Formula 1 racing)




## How are Global Competencies met {.smaller}

``Historical / Cultural Awareness``

- Contextual Understanding: 
    * Paper contextualizes current research by exploring the historical development and use of statistical models (e.g. in sports analytics)


``Respect & Understanding Perspectives``

- Inclusion of Different Views: 
    * Paper considers and address different perspectives
    * Paper offers comparisons to existing alternative methods

- Effective Communication: 
    * Present complex mathematical ideas clearly to a broad audience




## Recommended Enhancement {.smaller}

**New assignment for Statistical Models:**

- Students write a **short paper** on the Statistical Analysis of a problem

- Problem is chosen from a list given by the Lecturer


**Major difficulties:**

- Sourcing problem topics
    * I can re-use case studies already present in current Coursework 

- Marking rubric (what makes a good paper?)
    * Important: Originality will not be a requirement
    * Elements of good mathematical analysis and communication must be met



## Exploring the literature {.smaller}

**Devising Marking Rubric:** Reference [@pak]^[My notes on [@pak] are found in **Reference 3** in the [Annotated Bibliography](/files/annotated_bibliography.pdf)] 

- Critical role of clarity in academic writing, particularly in mathematical papers
  * Enhance a researcher's visibility
  * Increase the likelihood of citations

- Provides a comprehensive guide to the publication process in mathematics
  * Structuring a paper
  * Proper referencing
  * Effective writing styles (Maths)
  * Tips for using LaTeX

- Insights from [@pak] + My own experience can be used to design Marking Rubric
