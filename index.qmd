## Meso Context {.smaller}
### Statistical Models is part of the Data Science Pathway

![](images/meso.png){width=70%}


::: {.notes}

Statistical Models is a Y2 Model in T2
It is part of Data Science Pathway

It builds on Probability & Statistics which is a compulsory module in Year 1 T2.

General understanding from other foundational Year 1 modules 
is also required: Calculus and Linear Algebra.

Follow up optional modules in Year 3 which belong 
to Data Science Pathway are:
- Numerical Computation (since this module focusses on statistical software)
- Data Science (which builds directly on the techniques learned in Statistical Models)

:::



## Macro Context {.smaller}

- **Statistical Models** is part of **BSc in Mathematics**

- BSc in Mathematics meets standards of the

    * **MSOR:** Mathematics, Statistics & Operations Research

- BSc in Mathematics is accredited by
    * Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA)
    * IMA accredits courses which meet its [requirements](https://ima.org.uk/university-degree-programme-accreditation/)
    * Graduates attain the **IMA Chartered Mathematician status**

## Inclusive Education Framework Checklist {.smaller}

![](images/IEF_Checklist.png){width=80%}




## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #1

`Students are given choices within their assessments to allow for personalisation`

- 10 Worksheets: marked and returned to students with feedback
- Maths Department Policy: Students allowed to miss small # of Worksheets  
*(avoiding the Universityâ€™s mitigating circumstances process)*
- Allows students freedom to prioritise their preferred topics  
*(all topics are eventuallu assessed via Coursework at the end of the module)*

In line with [Hull IEF Assessment & Feedback](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback)

- **Be mindful of student workload and anxieties around assessment**
 


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #2

`Module uses a range of assessment formats`


1. 10 weekly Worksheets:
    * Purpose: To provide continuous summative and formative feedback
    * Each Worksheet accounts for a low percentage of final grade 
    * Including low-stakes regular assessments is an inclusive assessment for learning practice


    


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #2

`Module uses a range of assessment formats`


2. Coursework Portfolio:
    * Perform statistical analyses of real-world datasets
    * Report + Discuss statistical analyses 
    * Exactly the same as statisticians working in industry would have to do
    * Opportunity to demonstrate depth of understanding

In line with [Hull IEF Assessment & Feedback](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback)

- **Give students authentic opportunities to demonstrate their skills, knowledge and self-awareness**




## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`Mathematics assessment is designed at the programme level,   giving students a manageable assessment load`

- Mathematics assessment is **indeed** designed at the programme level

- Managing assessment load is **tricky** 
    * Due to inherently high amount of content for Maths disciplines
    * Partly due to limited staff and high turnover



## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`Mathematics assessment is designed at the programme level,   giving students a manageable assessment load`

- Statistical Models students in T2 had:
    * At least 1 more module with 10 Weekly Assignments
    * At least 1 more module with Coursework due in last week

- Mitigating these issues:
    * Best 7 Weekly Assignments count  
    *([Hull IEF Assessment & Feedback](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback) + Maths Department Policy)*
    * Coursework made available at beginning of T2  
    *(Point 5 of [Inclusive Assessment, Marking & Feedback Policy](https://www.hull.ac.uk/choose-hull/university-and-region/key-documents/docs/inclusive-assessment-marking-and-feedback-policy.pdf))*

## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example

`My teaching resources are made available in appropriate accessible formats in advance of scheduled teaching sessions wherever possible`

- I always upload teaching material at least 24h before sessions
- Statistical Models: I inherited teaching material in the form of PDF format slides 
- I wanted to use something more accessible than PDFs for my slides 

- Employed digital publication framework [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to write slides  
*(The present set of slides is made with Quarto)*



## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example

`My teaching resources are made available in appropriate accessible formats in advance of scheduled teaching sessions wherever possible`

- My slides are available in digital HTML format to view in browsers ([Link](https://www.silviofanzon.com/2024-Statistical-Models-Slides/))
    * Allows for easy viewing on various devices, including smartphones
    * Facilitates the use of accessibility features on smart devices  
    *(e.g. text magnification, contrast enhancement)*




## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example

`My teaching resources are made available in appropriate accessible formats in advance of scheduled teaching sessions wherever possible`


- Digital format allows for compatibility with text-to-speech software  
*(overcoming the limitations often encountered with PDFs)* 
    * Beneficial to auditory learners
    * Beneficial to students with visual impairments
    
- My slides are also available in PDF version on Canvas
    * Easy to print


In line with [Hull IEF Curriculum](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Curriculum): **Demonstrate inclusion where possible**
 



## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`I work with students as active partners in curriculum design and delivery`

- Statistical Models comprises 2 Weekly Lectures of 2h each

- The amount of content covered in class is quite high

- Current lectures design is classical
    * Deliver content with slides and whiteboard
    * Foster engagement and assess understanding with direct questions

- Mixed results
    * Students did not feel part of the class
    * Low engagement during some of the more technical lectures



## Recommended Enhancements {.smaller}

I wanted to find alternative teaching techniques to 

- Foster student engagement 
- Make students into a collective

Proposed enhancements *(Formative assessment)*

- *Team tasks*
    * Students work collaboratively in teams on a problem
    * Feedback shared across the group with teacher prompts

- *Students as Teachers*
    * At the end of the task students explain solution to each other

- These approaches are discussed in Reference 1 in the [Annotated Bibliography](/files/annotated_bibliography.pdf) 




## Recommended Enhancements {.smaller}

How to implement enhancements

- Already included numerous worked examples in the Statistical Models Slides
- Easily transform these examples into short tasks for students to solve in pairs
- To further stimulate student interest I can include tasks grounded in real-world applications

Possible impediments

- I have already attempted this approach with a couple of tasks this year
- Students really appreciated
- Next year I plan to have 1 interactive task per lecture
- Low effort high gain strategy -- I see no impediments in implementing it

## Evaluation of Sustainability {.smaller}

![](images/IC_Checklist_1.png){width=75%}


## Approach for evaluation

- evaluated curriculum against SDGs and ESD competencies

- My moduleâ€™s Programme Competencies map closely to ESD competencies 1, 4 & 7 (explain how these are taught and assessed, note intent to articulate this mapping to students)

- SDGs already present in my module:
4 Quality Education (use principles of TP to evidence)
16 Peace and Justice (explain case study activity, note positive student feedback)


- Plan to expand case studies for students to select from several appropriate SDG-aligned themes (e.g. SDG 5, 8, 12)

- Research staff/student co-design initiatives for SDG module integration

- ESD5 (collaborative working) could suit my module â€“ explore recent pedagogic innovations in my discipline



## Highlights of Analysis
